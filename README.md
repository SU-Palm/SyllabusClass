# SyllabusClass
For CSE 400 Web Arch at Syracuse University

Quick Qescription:
This project is a syllabus uploading website that allows users to view classes that are generated and posted to the mongodb database.
Currently the syllabus uploading is broken and cannot upload any syllabus due to not having enough knowledge on the coding language we used.

How to Run this project
In order to run this project you first need to build the node modules for the front end and back end. You need node.js installed and you
also need npm enabled within your command line. 

1. C:\SyllabusClass> cd frontend

2. C:\SyllabusClass\frontend> npm install

This command will install the required modules for frotnend into the frontend library.

3. C:\SyllabusClass\frontend> cd ..

4. C:\SyllabusClass> cd backend

5. C:\SyllabusClass\backend> npm install

This command will install the required modules for backend into the backend library.

6. C:\SyllabusClass\backend> cd ..

7. C:\SyllabusClass> cd frontend

8. C:\SyllabusClass\frontend> npm run dev

Running this last command will start the frontend and back end concurrently. Once this is up your browser should automatically open up
in the browser.
